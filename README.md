# Generic_Input-Output-GPIO-Raspberry
GPIO Control Input-Output  Script in Python and Tkinter

This Python script demonstrates the use of the RPi.GPIO library to control GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi. The script configures one GPIO pin as input, reading its state and printing the result. Additionally, it configures another GPIO pin as output, toggling its state between high and low.

Requirements:
- Raspberry Pi with RPi.GPIO library installed
- Raspberry pi
-Switches or sensors
-indicators
-Electronic components (resistors)

Usage:
1. Connect a switch/button to the input GPIO pin.
2. Connect an LED to the output GPIO pin via a current-limiting resistor.
3. Run this script to read the input state and toggle the output state.
